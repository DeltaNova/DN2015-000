# DN2015-000 - "The Ratter"

"The Ratter" is a project to enhance a rat trap with a wireless notification system. A trap is of no use if it has already triggered.

The code builds upon what I have been working on in my RFM69W repo. Development had reached the stage where application specific functionality needed to be added.
